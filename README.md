# 2D-Ising-Model-Simulation

The main purpose of this simulation is to analyse a 2-dimensional magnetic system described by the Ising model. It consists on a square-lattice with N particles positioned on each lattice vertex. The Hamiltonian is designed in such a way that spins are in binary spin states S (+1 or -1). Moreover, their interaction is a nearest-neighbor interaction (K-NN = 1-NN). 

Interesting conclusions can be drawn upon examination of this simple system. First, by studying the key system features, such as energy and magnetization. Second, by studying critical exponents and their scalability.
