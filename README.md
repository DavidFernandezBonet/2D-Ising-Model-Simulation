# 2D-Ising-Model-Simulation

The main purpose of this simulation is to analyse a 2-dimensional magnetic system described by the Ising model. It consists on a square-lattice with N particles positioned on each vertex formed by the lattice. Particles are in binary spin states S (+1 or -1) and exhibit interaction with their nearest neighbours.
